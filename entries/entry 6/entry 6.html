        <span>When I first saw the box, I was not immediately drawn to buy it. </span>
        <br>
        <span> However, after checking out reviews and ratings on a figure website, my expectations roseâ€”especially after seeing positive comments about its charming, </span>
        <br>
        <span>miniature keyring style. Once I had it, I could not agree more. </span>
        <br>
        <span>The tiny, three-dimensional figure is absolutely adorable, with its plastic packaging adding a nice touch </span>
        <br>
        <span>that complements the mini-figure inside. My only gripe is that it can be a bit tricky to make the figure stand upright.</span>
