<div>This is the one that I have!</div>
<p>I found this figure on the website YAMI and bought it right away!<p>
  <p>Price : $6.39 (Not a bad price compared to other figures)<p>
   <p>This figure is definitely the star of the package! It is one of those adorable pieces that just begs to be displayed. Seriously, it is *so* cute!! The only tiny letdown is that it is smaller than I expected. Because of that, it does not pop as much next to the other figures in my collection. Still, it is a lovely addition and worth having!<p>
  <p>Rate:3.5 out of 5!<p>
